# JIRA Sprint Cards
When making a Scrum board skip making post-its for the stories and use JIRA Sprint Cards to specify a list of JIRA issues to generate a print ready webpage. Simply cut out the issues and tape to your Scrum board.

## Requirements
You'll need to be using the following to run the Python Script:
* Access to [Atlassian JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
* [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
* [easygui](http://easygui.sourceforge.net/)

To run the Mac application:
* Access to [Atlassian JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
* OS X v10.8

## Included
Here's what you got:
* [jiraReport.py](https://github.com/jyoakum/JIRA-Sprint-Cards/blob/master/src/jiraReport.py)
  * Note: If running from the terminal you'll have to click on the input box to set the focus.
* [jiraReport.app.zip](https://github.com/jyoakum/JIRA-Sprint-Cards/releases/download/v1.0-alpha/jiraReport.app.zip)

## Future Improvements
Once I figure out how I want to share the details within the context of a github repo, I'll be adding information on how to make a [py2app](http://pythonhosted.org/py2app/) Mac application from the Python script.
