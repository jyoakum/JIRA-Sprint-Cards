We need to migrate the sonarRunner gradle block into its own gradle plugin, in which each project can configure individually without having to copy/paste the same sonarRunner block.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></div><hr><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;max-height:400px;overflow:hidden"><h1>APIDEV-728 - Review and revise P&A response data (Gerbil)</h1><p style="width: 550px;"><b>SP:</b> 8.0 <b>Description</b>: The pricing and availability data from the LPAS Library is being run through a processor that adds it to the Gerbil response. This converted data needs to be analyzed for correctness and completeness. Any problems should be resolved as part of this story.<br><br>As a consumer of the Hotel List Service, I want to be assured that all pricing and availability data is accurate and complete.<br><br>Acceptance criteria:<br># Any new monetary type info that has been added last sprint is also supported here<br># All pricing and availability fields are reviewed for correctness and completeness.<br>** Rate details need to include a rate plan code (see attached email for more details).<br># Any incorrect data has been corrected.<br># Any missing data has been added.<br># Any problems that cannot be solved as part of this story are documented on Confluence.<br># This Sonar violation is resolved: http://sonar.ean/drilldown/violations/30506<br># Issue is corrected where LPAS Dynamic Rate rules credits  are being mapped as Coupons<br># Issue is resolved where number of nights and rooms is always 0 in hotel-list-response<br>#  Issue is corrected where LPAS returns a list of extra guest fees - broken out by adult, child (and probably infant).  However the Hotel-List response<br>does not indicate the type of extra guest fee.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></div><hr><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;max-height:400px;overflow:hidden"><h1>KC-165 - Define Functioning Service</h1><p style="width: 550px;"><b>SP:</b> None <b>Description</b>: As a concerned engineer, I want a better way of deciding whether an instance is dead since we can return non-200 status codes from a functional server.<br><br>Reminder:<br>* This applies to using Eureka.<br>* This applies to the status page.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></div><hr></body></html>
